## ✅ TASK 1: Web Scraping

* Scraped laptop product data (title, price, description) from a public e-commerce test website using **BeautifulSoup**.
* Created a custom CSV dataset (`laptop_data.csv`) for analysis.

## 📊 TASK 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Explored dataset structure and types using `pandas`.
* Cleaned and processed price data.
* Identified trends, outliers, and common keywords in laptop titles.
* Used summary statistics and basic hypothesis framing.

## 📈 TASK 3: Data Visualization

* Visualized price distribution with **histograms** and **boxplots**.
* Analyzed top words in product titles using **bar charts**.
* Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for clear, insightful plots.

## 💬 TASK 4: Sentiment Analysis

* Simulated product reviews for laptops.
* Performed **sentiment classification** (positive, neutral, negative) using **TextBlob**.
* Visualized sentiment distribution to understand public opinion.
